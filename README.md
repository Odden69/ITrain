This is a web based app made to give the user a simple but effective tool to plan and track their gym workouts.
It is flexible in the sense that the user can add all the exercises and workouts they want and don't need to use an app crowded with extra

## User Experience
### Target Audience
The target audience for Itrain is people of all ages who regularly workout at a gym and who like to take control over their own training by planning their workouts.
The app gives the user the opportunity to create and edit exercises and put them together into workouts.
There are default exercises provided by an admin user, but apart from that all exercises and workouts are private and not shared between users.

The focus of this app is usability, both on a computer and on a mobile since it is important to be able to use the app at the gym and, for convenience, do the planning on a computer. Hence a fully responsive site is required.
